Analysis of Windows Event logs using Pandas DataFrame

**What's Windows Event log:**

The Windows event log is a detailed record of system, security and application notifications stored by the Windows operating system that is used by administrators to diagnose system problems and predict future issues. Applications and the operating system (OS) use these event logs to record important hardware and software actions that the administrator can use to troubleshoot issues with the operating system. The Windows operating system tracks specific events in its log files, such as application installations, security management, system setup operations on initial startup, and problems or errors.

A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
